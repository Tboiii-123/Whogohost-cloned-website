Indexdb with Jquery

When opening indexdb we use the code



var request =indexdDB.open('THe name of the database',4)

The {4} means the version  of the web browser used



If there is an upgrade in the database we use the code the variabe name to create the indexbd and weith the request method or attribute


request.onupgradeneeded and a function in it

The syantax is

            request.onupgradeneeded =function(e){
                var db = e.target.result;
                console.log("Data base creayed successfully")
            }

For handling of error we use the word onerror and on


When talking to the database we use the key word transaction

The transaction syntax

var transaction =db.transaction(['The name of the db','The ,method of the file'])


Methods of the file are;

readwrite
read
write
